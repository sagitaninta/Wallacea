# Wallacea
This is the repository for custom scripts used in Aninta and Drinkwater et al (2024) on "The importance of small island populations for the long term survival of endangered large-bodied insular mammals".

The repository has three folders which corresponds to the three non-standard pipeline we used to calculate the per-site per-individual mutational load using genotype likelihood (Alberto Carmagnini), the composite likelihood of the SFS (Sabhrina Gita Aninta), and the habitat suitability modelling (by Rosie Drinkwater). The documentation on how to start each pipeline are provided in each folder's README.md.
